# CS6910 Assignment -3

## Authors

## General Instructions:
Used recurrent neural networks to build a transliteration system.

Install the required libraries using the following command :

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Along with jupyter notebooks we have also given python code filed (.py) files. These contain the code to direclty train and test the CNN in a non interactive way.

If you are running the jupyter notebooks on colab, the libraries from the requirements.txt file are preinstalled, with the exception of wandb. You can install wandb by using the following command :

    !pip install wandb

The dataset for this project can be found at :

### 2. Libraries Used: 

- Used the pytoch, __pytorchvision__ and other necessary libraries for the CNN model buiding and training.

### 3. Device:
I have write and run the code in Jupyter notebook and used GPU of my system for training.
